This is a pure frontend project with all data stored locally in your browser and never uploaded to any server, making the online version both safe and reliable to use.

### 2. Vercel Deployment
Method 1: One-click deployment to your own Vercel:
   [![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Flinshenkx%2Fprompt-optimizer)

Method 2: Fork the project and import to Vercel (Recommended):
   - First fork the project to your GitHub account
   - Then import the project to Vercel
   - This allows tracking of source project updates for easy syncing of new features and fixes
- Configure environment variables:
  - `ACCESS_PASSWORD`: Set access password to enable access restriction
  - `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY` etc.: Configure API keys for various AI service providers

### 3. Download Desktop Application
Download the latest version from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/linshenkx/prompt-optimizer/releases). We provide both **installer** and **archive** formats for each platform.

- **Installer (Recommended)**: Such as `*.exe`, `*.dmg`, `*.AppImage`, etc. **Strongly recommended as it supports automatic updates**.
- **Archive**: Such as `*.zip`. Extract and use, but cannot auto-update.

**Core Advantages of Desktop Application**:
- ✅ **No CORS Limitations**: As a native desktop application, it completely eliminates browser Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issues. This means you can directly connect to any AI service provider's API, including locally deployed Ollama or commercial APIs with strict security policies, for the most complete and stable functional experience.
- ✅ **Automatic Updates**: Versions installed through installers (like `.exe`, `.dmg`) can automatically check and update to the latest version.
- ✅ **Independent Operation**: No browser dependency, providing faster response and better performance.

### 7. MCP Server Usage Instructions
<details>
<summary>Click to view MCP Server usage instructions</summary>

Prompt Optimizer now supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling integration with AI applications that support MCP such as Claude Desktop.

When running via Docker, the MCP Server automatically starts and can be accessed via `http://ip:port/mcp`.

#### Environment Variable Configuration

MCP Server requires API key configuration to function properly. Main MCP-specific configurations:

```bash
# MCP Server Configuration
MCP_DEFAULT_MODEL_PROVIDER=openai  # Options: openai, gemini, deepseek, siliconflow, zhipu, custom
MCP_LOG_LEVEL=info                 # Log level
```

#### Using MCP in Docker Environment

In a Docker environment, the MCP Server runs alongside the web application. You can access the MCP service through the same port as the web application at the `/mcp` path.

For example, if you map the container's port 80 to port 8081 on the host:
```bash
docker run -d -p 8081:80 \
  -e VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key \
  -e MCP_DEFAULT_MODEL_PROVIDER=openai \
  --name prompt-optimizer \
  linshen/prompt-optimizer
```

The MCP Server will then be accessible at `http://localhost:8081/mcp`.

#### Claude Desktop Integration Example

To use Prompt Optimizer in Claude Desktop, you need to add the service configuration to Claude Desktop's configuration file.

1. Find Claude Desktop's configuration directory:
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\services`
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/services`
   - Linux: `~/.config/Claude/services`

2. Edit or create the `services.json` file, adding the following content:

```json
{
  "services": [
    {
      "name": "Prompt Optimizer",
      "url": "http://localhost:8081/mcp"
    }
  ]
}
```

Make sure to replace `localhost:8081` with the actual address and port where you've deployed Prompt Optimizer.

#### Available Tools

- **optimize-user-prompt**: Optimize user prompts to improve LLM performance
- **optimize-system-prompt**: Optimize system prompts to improve LLM performance
- **iterate-prompt**: Iteratively improve mature prompts based on specific requirements

## ⚙️ API Key Configuration

<details>
<summary>Click to view API key configuration methods</summary>

### Method 1: Via Interface (Recommended)
1. Click the "⚙️Settings" button in the upper right corner
2. Select the "Model Management" tab
3. Click on the model you need to configure (such as OpenAI, Gemini, DeepSeek, etc.)
4. Enter the corresponding API key in the configuration box
5. Click "Save"

Supported models: OpenAI, Gemini, DeepSeek, Zhipu AI, SiliconFlow, Custom API (OpenAI compatible interface)

In addition to API keys, you can configure advanced LLM parameters for each model individually. These parameters are configured through a field called `llmParams`, which allows you to specify any parameters supported by the LLM SDK in key-value pairs for fine-grained control over model behavior.

**Advanced LLM Parameter Configuration Examples:**
- **OpenAI/Compatible APIs**: `{"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 4096, "timeout": 60000}`
- **Gemini**: `{"temperature": 0.8, "maxOutputTokens": 2048, "topP": 0.95}`
- **DeepSeek**: `{"temperature": 0.5, "top_p": 0.9, "frequency_penalty": 0.1}`

For more detailed information about `llmParams` configuration, please refer to the [LLM Parameters Configuration Guide](docs/developer/llm-params-guide.md).

### Method 2: Via Environment Variables
Configure environment variables through the `-e` parameter when deploying with Docker:

```bash
-e VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key
-e VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key
-e VITE_DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_key
-e VITE_ZHIPU_API_KEY=your_key
-e VITE_SILICONFLOW_API_KEY=your_key
-e VITE_CUSTOM_API_KEY=your_custom_api_key

## FAQ

<details>
<summary>Click to view frequently asked questions</summary>

### API Connection Issues

#### Q1: Why can't I connect to the model service after configuring the API key?
**A**: Most connection failures are caused by **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)** issues. As this project is a pure frontend application, browsers block direct access to API services from different origins for security reasons. Model services will reject direct requests from browsers if CORS policies are not correctly configured.

#### Q2: How to solve Ollama connection issues?
**A**: Ollama fully supports the OpenAI standard interface, just configure the correct CORS policy:
1. Set environment variable `OLLAMA_ORIGINS=*` to allow requests from any origin
2. If issues persist, set `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434` to listen on any IP address

#### Q3: How to solve CORS issues with commercial APIs (such as Nvidia's DS API, ByteDance's Volcano API)?
**A**: These platforms typically have strict CORS restrictions. Recommended solutions:

1. **Use Vercel Proxy** (Convenient solution)
   - Use the online version: [prompt.always200.com](https://prompt.always200.com)
   - Or deploy to your own Vercel platform
   - Check "Use Vercel Proxy" option in model settings
   - Request flow: Browser → Vercel → Model service provider
   - For detailed steps, please refer to the [Vercel Deployment Guide](docs/user/deployment/vercel_en.md)

2. **Use self-deployed API proxy service** (Reliable solution)
   - Deploy open-source API aggregation/proxy tools like OneAPI
   - Configure as custom API endpoint in settings
   - Request flow: Browser → Proxy service → Model service provider

#### Q4: What are the drawbacks or risks of using Vercel proxy?
**A**: Using Vercel proxy may trigger risk control mechanisms of some model service providers. Some vendors may identify requests from Vercel as proxy behavior, thereby limiting or denying service. If you encounter this issue, we recommend using a self-deployed proxy service.

#### Q5: I have correctly configured CORS policies for my local model (like Ollama), why can't I still connect using the online version?
**A**: This is caused by the browser's **Mixed Content security policy**. For security reasons, browsers block secure HTTPS pages (like the online version) from sending requests to insecure HTTP addresses (like your local Ollama service).

**Solutions**:
To bypass this limitation, you need to have the application and API under the same protocol (e.g., both HTTP). We recommend the following approaches:
1. **Use the desktop version**: Desktop applications have no browser restrictions and are the most stable and reliable way to connect to local models.
2. **Docker deployment**: Docker deployment also uses HTTP
3. **Use Chrome extension**: Extensions can bypass some security restrictions in certain situations.
